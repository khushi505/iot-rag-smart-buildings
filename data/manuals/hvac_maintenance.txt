If the temperature of the HVAC unit exceeds 35Â°C, this may indicate possible overheating.
Recommended checks include:
- Inspect air filters for clogging.
- Examine coolant levels in the compressor system.
- Inspect belts and bearings for signs of wear.
- Make sure the ventilation system is not blocked.
In case of vibrations over 0.15, check motor alignment and loose parts.
